# many-rust-file-readerss
This is a small repo created as a tool that can be later used to simply parse a file get the important data out and parse it in the way you want
These are simple functions and that's all. Optimal? I don't think so. Working? yes for sure. If something changes in the future I will edit it accordingly.
Till then Enjoy!!
